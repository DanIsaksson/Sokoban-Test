Sokoban
----------

### 1. Sokoban Game

You are going to create a simple JavaScript game, based on the game
called "Sokoban". The first task is to create the game board itself. You will
be given an array of characters that represents a tile-based map. Your task
is to take that character array, and turn it into a grid of html elements that
can be used to represent the map, that the player can then move around
inside. The second part of making the game is to create functions to be
able to move your player through the game using the arrow keys on the
keyboard. The game should respond to inputs without the normal
behavior of the arrow keys (i.e. scrolling in the web page).

### 2. Required Features

* A player object that can move in a grid of html elements representing a
tile-based game board.
* Create functions to get the keypresses to move your player, up, down,
left and right.
* Walls should stop the player.
* One movable block can be pushed by the player into an empty space,
while two blocks should not.
* The game should end once all blocks have been pushed into the right
spaces on the game board.

### 3. Code Requirements

* The grid map, player and blocks must be made up of html elements
created through JavaScript commands.
* The game map must be based on the attached JavaScript array,
SokobanBase.js.
